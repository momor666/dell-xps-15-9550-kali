Make the following changes to ```/etc/sysctl.conf```:

Uncomment the following settings:
```

# Prevent some spoofing attacks
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=1
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1

# Do not accept ICMP redirects (prevent MITM attacks)
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0

# Do not send ICMP redirects (we are not a router)
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0 

# Log Martian Packets
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1

```

Check settings with ```sysctl <settingname>```
